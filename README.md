- Hi, I’m @Lumen000
- I'm just an average Asian, and I find myself pretty average, among asians, in the areas that Asians are meant to be good at. 
- These include: being insecure, being bad at creative things, having bad eyesight, being paranoid, being bad at speling and having a rubbish sense of humour.
- If you want to contact me, give up.
